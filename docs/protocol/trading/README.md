description: Buying and selling FEI

# Trading

This section applies to buying and selling FEI from the protocol or on incentivized FEI Uniswap pools. Users can always buy and sell on secondary markets where they exist.

## Buying FEI

Users can acquire FEI in the following \(non-exhaustive\) ways:

* Using the [FeiRouter](feirouter.md), exposed on [app.fei.money](https://app.fei.money)
* Buying from the [bonding curve](../bondingcurve/ethbondingcurve.md)
* Buying directly on the ETH/FEI Uniswap pool

The bonding curve is currently not exposed via [app.fei.money](https://app.fei.money). The Fei Core Team is considering a feature to optimize the trading price of Fei Protocol UI by going to the bonding curve if offers a better deal. 

## Selling FEI

The router is exposed on [app.fei.money](https://app.fei.money), with parameters to protect against slippage and bound penalties.
