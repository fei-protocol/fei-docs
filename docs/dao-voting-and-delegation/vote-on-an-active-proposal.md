# Vote on an Active Proposal

Before getting started, ensure that you have connected your wallet.

{% page-ref page="connect-your-wallet.md" %}

Also confirm you have voting power delegated to your address. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that tokens you own are not active for voting until you delegate. **You must delegate to yourself if you wish to vote on proposals directly with your own tokens.**
{% endhint %}

{% page-ref page="delegate-votes.md" %}

## How to Vote:

Select the active proposal that you'd like to vote on. You can access this from the [Fei Protocol Governance](https://www.withtally.com/governance/fei) page, and then scroll down below the delegate voting power chart.

Click on the "vote" button in the upper right corner of the page.
