# Delegate Votes

Before getting started, ensure that you have connected your wallet. 

You can delegate votes to yourself or to another address. **This only must be done once.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note tokens you own are not active for voting until you delegate. You must delegate to yourself if you wish to vote on proposals directly with your own tokens.**
{% endhint %}

First, navigate to the Fei Protocol governance page: [https://www.withtally.com/governance/fei](https://www.withtally.com/governance/fei). 

## Delegate to yourself \(set up wallet for direct voting\):

Click on the button to "delegate to self".

## Delegate votes to another address:

Navigate to the delegate leaderboard at the bottom of the Fei Protocol [governance](https://www.withtally.com/governance/fei) page. If your preferred delegate is not in the top 10 addresses by voting power, click on the "view all" link to view additional delegates.

## Confirm your delegation status:

Start by navigating to your address's voter page. If you are among the top 100 addresses by voting power, you can link to your voter page through the "top voters" table at the bottom of the governance page. Alternatively, you can view your address's voter page by pasting the following link into your browser with the relevant details.

[`https://www.withtally.com/voter/[your ethereum address]/governance/fei`](https://www.withtally.com/voter/0x66b9d411e14fbc86424367b67933945fd7e40b11/governance/fei)\`\`

Once you've accessed your voter page, review the "delegating to" section on the right hand side. If you delegated votes to yourself \(set up your address for direct voting\), you should see "self delegation".

If you delegated votes to another address, this section will display a link to that address's voter page.
