# TimelockedDelegator

## Contract

[TimelockedDelegator.sol](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/dao/TimelockedDelegator.sol) implements [ITimelockedDelegator](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/dao/ITimelockedDelegator.sol), [LinearTokenTimelock](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/utils/LinearTokenTimelock.sol)

## Description

A TRIBE token timelock which allows subdelegation. Managed by the Fei Core Team to distribute vested TRIBE and voting rights to team members and investors.

The contract receives TRIBE tokens that vest linearly over a 4 year schedule to a beneficiary. 

{% page-ref page="../references/lineartokentimelock.md" %}

### Sub-Delegation

During the elected timelock period, any TRIBE in the timelock can be sub-delegated to any address. The TimelockedDelegator creates a proxy delegate contract which escrows the TRIBE and sub-delegates. It can then withdraw voting rights at any time. 

The beneficiary decides where to delegate and undelegate. All TRIBE held in the timelock that is not sub-delegated is delegated to the beneficiary.
