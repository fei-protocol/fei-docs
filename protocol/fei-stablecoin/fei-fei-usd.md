# FEI \(Fei USD\)

## Contract

[Fei.sol](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/token/Fei.sol) implements [IFei.sol](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/token/IFei.sol), [CoreRef](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/refs/CoreRef.sol), [ERC20Burnable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Burnable)

## Description

FEI is a regular ERC-20 token, based on the OpenZeppelin ERC-20Burnable code with the following modifications:

Minting and burning to any address are uncapped and accessible by any address with the Minterüí∞and Burnerüî• role, respectively.

At each transfer \(or transferFrom\) the following addresses are checked for a mapped incentive contract:

* FEI sender
* FEI receiver
* FEI operator \(msg.sender\) - commonly the same as the sender unless using transferFrom with an approved contract
* the zero address - represens an incentive to be applied on ALL transfers

If an incentive contract is found, it is called with all of the transfer parameters. Any incentive is applied after the token balances update from the transfer.

## Read-Only Functions

### incentiveContract

```javascript
function incentiveContract(address account) external view returns (address);
```

returns the mapped incentive contract if `account` is an incentivized address, otherwise returns the 0 address.

{% hint style="info" %}
if the 0 address has a mapped incentive contract, then this incentive contract is called for every single FEI transfer.
{% endhint %}

## Burner-Onlyüî• State-Changing Functions

### burnFrom

```javascript
function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) external;
```

Burns `amount` FEI from `account`. Reverts if the FEI balance of `account` is less than `amount`

emits `Burning`

## Minter-Onlyüí∞ State-Changing Functions

### mint

```javascript
function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external;
```

Mints `amount` FEI to `account`

emits `Minting`

## Governor-Only‚öñÔ∏è State-Changing Functions

### setIncentiveContract

```javascript
function setIncentiveContract(address account, address incentive) external;
```

Sets the incentive contract `incentive` for `account`. If `incentive` is the 0 address this functions as an unset.

emits `IncentiveContractUpdate`

## Public State-Changing Functions

### burn

```javascript
function burn(uint256 amount) external;
```

Burns `amount` FEI from `msg.sender`. Reverts if the FEI balance of `msg.sender` is less than `amount`

emits `Burning`

### permit

```javascript
function permit(
    address owner,
    address spender,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
) external;
```

Sets the allowance for a `spender` for `value` FEI from `owner` via signature. Reverts if called after `deadline`
