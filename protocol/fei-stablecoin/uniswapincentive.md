# UniswapIncentive

## Contract

[UniswapIncentive.sol](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/token/UniswapIncentive.sol) implements [IUniswapIncentive](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/token/IUniswapIncentive.sol), [UniRef](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/master/contracts/refs/UniRef.sol)

## Description

{% hint style="info" %}
Because this contract can be swapped for a new UniswapIncentive, for integrations we recommend calling`incentiveContract(0x94B0A3d511b6EcDb17eBF877278Ab030acb0A878)`on the FEI token to always read the currently applied UniswapIncentive on the ETH-FEI pair
{% endhint %}

The FEI incentive contract applied on transfers involving a Uniswap pair.

The UniswapIncentive contract assumes that all transfers involving Uniswap are either a sell or a buy. In either case, the hypothetical start and end price are calculated then compared to the peg to capture the magnitude distance _m_. See UniRef for more details on how these formulas are derived.

{% page-ref page="../references/uniref.md" %}

These parameters are fed into the incentive function to produce a mint \(in the case of buy\) or burn \(in the case of sell\) action. Any address can be exempted from incentives by governance.

{% hint style="info" %}
The below incentives only apply to the FEI portion of the trade that would be below the peg. When calculating "x", the contract uses the "distance from peg FEI" method in [UniRef](../references/uniref.md).
{% endhint %}

### Sell \(Burn\)

All FEI transfers going TO the uniswap pool are treated as a sell. This has the counterintuitive effect of treating liquidity provision as a sell.

The implementation integrates the burn function from the [white paper](../../whitepaper.md) with respect to the distance from the peg. This creates a nice path independent property where a trader is no better off doing one large trade or many small trades, ignoring fees. The burn formula for sell amount _x_ is: 

![Burn formula for selling FEI](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-02-23-at-8.10.49-am.png)

The burn is only applied to trades below the peg when the incentive contract is appointed as a Burnerüî•.

The burn is taken from the in-flight trade amount. If the burn is 5% on a 100 FEI transfer then the recipient gets 95 FEI. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The entire trade size including the burn is used to calculate the slippage for the end deviation from the peg. This could lead to a higher than expected burn for large trades when below peg.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The trade will revert if the burn would be greater than or equal to the entire transfer amount
{% endhint %}

### Buy \(Mint\)

All transfers going FROM the uniswap pool are treated as a buy. This has the counterintuitive effect of treating liquidity withdrawal events as buys.

The initial magnitude _m_ deviation from the peg before the hypothetical trade is used to maximize the potential mint amount. _w_ is the time weight we discuss in the next section. The mint formula for buy amount _x_ is: 

![Incentive formula for buying FEI](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-02-23-at-8.21.09-am.png)

The incentive formula is normally just the right-hand side of the above min function. It is linear in the time weight `w(t)` and the distance from the peg `m`

When the incentive function for a trade reaches the same level as the burn for the same trade _in reverse_, the incentive function maxes out. This is because we don't want a trader to be able to profit by buying and selling with a flash loan under any circumstances.

The mint should only apply if the trade starts below the peg and if the incentive contract is appointed as a Minter.

### Incentivized Amount

The incentivized amount on Uniswap FEI-ETH trades is only calculated based on the amount that pushes FEI below the peg for a sell or up to the peg for a buy. For example say a trade starts 1% below the peg and ends 1% above, only approximately half of the trade will get the bonus.

### Time Weight

The time weight _w_ is a scaling factor utilized to make the incentive mint structured like an auction. The trader willing to accept the lowest mint will execute a buy before the reward gets higher.

The time weight grows linearly at a rate of 75/100,000 per block, which equals 1 after approximately 5 hours. It should only grow while "active" and will only be active when the last trade ended below the peg. The rate can be changed by governance. 

Trades should update the time weight as follows:

* If ending above peg, set to 0 and deactivate
* If ending below the peg but starting above, set to 0 and activate
* If starting and ending below peg, update pro-rata with a buy based on percent towards peg. E.g., if a trade starts at 10% deviation and ends at 1%, time weight should be scaled by 1%/10% =.10.
* If starting and ending below the peg, cap the time weight at the max incentive for the ending distance

### Incentive Parity

Incentive parity is defined as a boolean expression, which is true when the mint incentive equals its max for the current distance from the peg `m`. It simplifies down to the following:

![Condition for Incentive Parity](../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-02-14-at-1.13.12-pm%20%281%29.png)

Parity is used as a trigger condition for reweights in the [UniswapPCVController](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/wiki/UniswapPCVController)
