## References

Reference contracts \(refs\) are extensions to feature contracts that provide utilities related to certain functionality. There are 3 reference contracts in Fei Protocol:

{% page-ref page="coreref.md" %}

{% page-ref page="oracleref.md" %}

{% page-ref page="uniref.md" %}

## Utils

The two main utility contracts are the LinearTokenTimelock, which is used for storing Fei Core Team and investor tokens, and the Timed contract which is used to add time windows to various protocol functionality \(including the timelock\)
